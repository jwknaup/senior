@article{Haldane2016a,
abstract = {Several arboreal mammals have the ability to rapidly and repeatedly jump vertical distances of 2 m, starting from rest. We characterize this performance by a metric we call vertical jumping agility. Through basic kinetic relations, we show that this agility metric is fundamentally constrained by available actuator power. Although rapid high jumping is an important performance characteristic, the ability to control forces during stance also appears critical for sophisticated behaviors. The animal with the highest vertical jumping agility, the galago (Galago senegalensis), is known to use a power-modulating strategy to obtain higher peak power than that of muscle alone. Few previous robots have used series-elastic power modulation (achieved by combining series-elastic actuation with variable mechanical advantage), and because of motor power limits, the best current robot has a vertical jumping agility of only 55{\%} of a galago. Through use of a specialized leg mechanism designed to enhance power modulation, we constructed a jumping robot that achieved 78{\%} of the vertical jumping agility of a galago. Agile robots can explore venues of locomotion that were not previously attainable. We demonstrate this with a wall jump, where the robot leaps from the floor to a wall and then springs off the wall to reach a net height that is greater than that accessible by a single jump. Our results show that series-elastic power modulation is an actuation strategy that enables a clade of vertically agile robots.},

@article{Plecnik2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME.The leg mechanism of the novel jumping robot, Salto, is designed to achieve multiple functions during the sub-200 ms time span that the leg interacts with the ground, including minimizing impulse loading, balancing angular momentum, and manipulating power output of the robot's series-elastic actuator. This is all accomplished passively with a single degree-of-freedom linkage that has a coupled, unintuitive design which was synthesized using the technique described in this paper. Power delivered through the mechanism is increased beyond the motor's limit by using variable mechanical advantage to modulate energy storage and release in a series-elastic actuator. This power modulating behavior may enable high amplitude, high frequency jumps. We aim to achieve all required behaviors with a linkage composed only of revolute joints, simplifying the robot's hardware but necessitating a complex design procedure since there are no pre-existing solutions. The synthesis procedure has two phases: (1) design exploration to initially compile linkage candidates, and (2) kinematic tuning to incorporate power modulating characteristics and ensure an impulse-limited, rotation-free jump motion. The final design is an eight-bar linkage with a stroke greater than half the robot's total height that produces a simulated maximum jump power 3.6 times greater than its motor's limit. A 0.27m tall prototype is shown to exhibit minimal pitch rotations during meter high test jumps.},

abstract = {A properly designed elastic actuation can increase the jumping height that a legged robot can reach. In this paper we compare the two most popular conceptual soft actuator designs, parallel elastic (PEA) and series elastic (SEA), in the task of maximizing the jumping height. Such task is translated into an optimal control problem. For a simplified version of the problem an analytical solution is provided, while a problem with more realistic constraints (e.g. the linear torque-speed motor characteristic is taken into account) is stated as a convex optimization problem and numerically solved. The results show that: (i) given the power of the motor there exists an optimal constant stiffness that maximizes the performance for both the SEA and the PEA; (ii) the optimal stiffness depends on the task terminal time, the inertial parameters of the system and the reduction ratio of the motor; (iii) in the condition considered the SEA behaves better than the PEA.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a design method of nonlinear profile of gear ratio to utilize a DC servo motor effectively for a jumping robot. Because the larger ground force yields the higher kinetic energy of the robot body, the optimal gear ratio is obtained by the maximization of the ground force from statics point of view. Moreover, the varying gear ratio during the jump motion is obtained through a simulation which connects statics-based optimization and robot dynamics. A non-circular gear is synthesized which realizes the obtained optimal varying gear ratio. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by simulations.},

abstract = {From an engineering point of view, bio-inspiration can suggest mechanisms, design and functions successfully improving the state of the art in robotics. Engineers can study scaling effects in animal locomotion in order to determine the optimal gait for a given-size robot. In this paper the design of a miniature jumping robot is presented. Inspired by small jumping animals, the robot performs catapult jumps, using an elastic energy storage and a release mechanism. Compliant forelegs are completely passive, and cushion the landing re-using part of the impact energy. The influence of compliance and elastic energy storage on performances is discussed. Spring stiffness and elongation are dimensioned according to design limitations and energy constraints, avoiding early loss of ground contact, i.e. take-off before complete leg extension. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
